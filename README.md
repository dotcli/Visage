> Visage, an LED Mystical Hood costume

The costume is a fork of Adafruit's [Mystical LED Halloween Hood](https://learn.adafruit.com/mystical-led-halloween-hood/). In addition to the two LED eyes from Adafruit's tutorial, Visage adds one more LED, forming a triangle, or an alien face, or a Kodama face (Ghibli), or a "because" sign, or trisight, or a "therefore" sign.
